Silo Construction Cost Reduction

This project focuses on reducing the construction costs of silos by optimizing their geometric dimensions. By minimizing the radius and width of the silo, we achieve a significant reduction in the overall cost. The solution is developed using MATLAB and involves mathematical modeling and optimization techniques.
Features

    Optimization Model: Developed an optimization model to minimize the radius and width of the silo while maintaining structural integrity and capacity.
    Cost Analysis: Detailed analysis of cost savings achieved through the optimization.
    MATLAB Implementation: Solution implemented in MATLAB with a user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation.
    Visualization: Graphical representation of the optimized silo dimensions and cost savings.

Technologies Used

    MATLAB: For mathematical modeling, optimization, and visualization.
